# Maya Privacy Policy

This policy is effective as of 10 March 2023 and was last updated on 10 March 2023.

## User information the bot collects
Maya does neither collect nor store any personal user data.
## Command tracking
When you turn on the bot, it starts tracking some of your Tree commands. The term “tracking” refers to the name of these commands and the time when they were used.
This information is used to calculate how many commands you used in `/stats`.
You will get a warning that you enabled this when you use `/on`.

Important things to note:
• Tracking is only active if you manually activate Maya using `/on` first (opt-in).
• You can opt-out at any time by turning off tracking in `/settings user`. Disabling this feature does not impact any of the other functions of the bot.
• If you use `/off`, tracking - like everything else - will be disabled.

## Message content access
Maya has access to the content of all messages it can see. This access is necessary to create reminders.
Maya reads Tree messages and also reads the commands you issue to trigger said messages (e.g. if a prune message is detected, it will also read your `/prune` slash command or your `tree prune` message).
This data does usually (see below) not get stored and is immediately discarded.

**Exception**: If there is an error, the following data is stored in the error log:
• Content of the **Tree** message that couldn’t get processed correctly.
• A message link to the **Tree** message that couldn’t get processed correctly.

This means:
• Maya doesn’t store any messages sent by you.
• If the error happened in a private channel, I do not have access to that channel, as the stored message link will not work and simply give me an error.

## Limits of this policy
Please be aware that I have no control over the code and policies of forks and other projects that use Maya’s source code and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices.

This policy therefore only applies to:
• The code in the main repository, maintained by myself (https://github.com/Miriel-py/Maya-the-Bee).
• The bot instance with the username `Maya the Bee#7702`, hosted by myself. If you encounter another Maya with another discriminator, it is outside of the scope of this privacy policy.

The bot may also link to external sites that are not operated by me. The same limits apply to those sites.

## Changes to this policy
At my discretion, I may change my privacy policy to reflect updates. If I decide to change this privacy policy, I will post the changes here at the same link by which you are accessing this privacy policy.

## Contact me
For any questions or concerns regarding this privacy, you may contact me (Miriel#0001) on Discord directly.
