# Maya the Bee Privacy Policy

This policy is effective as of 10 March 2023 and was last updated on 19 October 2023.  

## User information the bot collects

Maya does neither collect nor store any personal user data.  

## Command tracking

When you turn on the bot, it starts tracking some of your Tree commands. The term “tracking” refers to the name of these commands and the time when they were used.  
This information is used to calculate how many commands you used in `/stats`.  
You will get a warning that you enabled this when you use `/on`.  

Important things to note:  
• Tracking is only active if you manually activate Maya using `/on` first (opt-in).  
• You can opt-out at any time by turning off tracking in `/settings user`. Disabling this feature does not impact any of the other functions of the bot.  
• If you use `/off`, tracking - like everything else - will be disabled.  

## Message content access

Maya has access to the content of all messages it can see. This access is necessary to create reminders.  
Maya reads Tree messages and also reads the commands you issue to trigger said messages (e.g. if a prune message is detected, it will also read your `/prune` slash command or your `tree prune` message).  

The bot caches all messages sent by users that either mention the Tree bot or start with `tree `. They are used to reduce API calls and increase performance. These messages are discarded after 10 minutes and **not** stored permanently.  

## Limits of this policy

Please be aware that I have no control over the code and policies of forks and other projects that use Maya’s source code and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices.  

This policy therefore only applies to:  
• The code in the [main repository](https://github.com/Miriel-py/Maya-the-Bee), maintained by myself.  
• The bot instance with the username `Maya the Bee#7702`, hosted by myself. If you encounter another Maya with another discriminator, it is outside of the scope of this privacy policy, even if it falsely links to this document.  

The bot may also link to external sites that are not operated by me. The same limits apply to those sites.  

## Changes to this policy

At my discretion, I may change my privacy policy to reflect updates. If I decide to change this privacy policy, I will post the changes here at the same link by which you are accessing this privacy policy.  

## Contact me

For any questions or concerns regarding this policy, you may contact me (Miriel#0001) in the [Maya the Bee support server](https://discord.gg/NShwfuGED2).
